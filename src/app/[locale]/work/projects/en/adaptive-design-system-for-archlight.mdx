## Overview

In this project, we developed an interactive image guessing quiz website using PHP as the backend to handle logic and data storage. The goal was to provide users with a fun and educational experience through an intuitive interface. This website is designed for users to guess the displayed images and answer related questions, creating an engaging learning experience.

## Key Features

- **Image Guessing Quiz**: Users can view the displayed images and choose answers from several available options. The interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, allowing users to interact with the quiz smoothly.
- **User Data Storage**: Implementing a secure login system to save user progress, scores, and quiz history, enabling users to continue their games at a later time.
- **Leaderboard**: Displaying user rankings based on the highest scores to encourage healthy competition among users, making the experience more enjoyable.
- **Quiz Management**: Admins can easily add, edit, or delete images and quiz questions through a user-friendly management interface, ensuring that content remains fresh and relevant.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: To build the backend that handles application logic and database interactions, as well as process user input.
- **MySQL**: As the database management system to store user data, images, and quiz questions.
- **HTML/CSS**: To build a responsive and visually appealing user interface, ensuring accessibility across various devices.
- **JavaScript**: To enhance interactivity and user experience on the frontend, including animations and input validation.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges in this project was creating a smooth and enjoyable user experience while guessing images, while also ensuring accuracy in score calculation. Extensive testing and user feedback were instrumental in identifying areas for improvement. Additionally, gaining experience in working with the MySQL database to ensure data integrity and security was invaluable.

## Results

The image guessing quiz website is now actively used by various users, increasing engagement and interest in learning while playing. This project not only provides a platform for education but also strengthens our development skills in using PHP and other web technologies.
